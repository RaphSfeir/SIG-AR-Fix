# This script and the entire SIG-AR-Fix folder should be located in the Plugins folder of Sketchup.
# SketchUp looks in its Plugins folder for ruby scripts every time it starts.
# 1. If you haven't already done so, install SketchUp or SketchUp Pro.
# 2. PC folks: Use Windows Explorer to locate your Plugins folder. It should be something like... 
#        c:\Program Files\Google\Google SketchUp [n]\Plugins
#    Mac folks: Use Finder. It should be something like... 
#        /Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp [n]/plugins 
#        ...or like... 
#        /Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp [n]/SketchUp/plugins
# 3. Paste the SIG-AR-Fix folder in the correct location, then restart SketchUp
